I am an Artificial Intelligence Doctoral Researcher at the University of Brighton. My current research is looking at applied machine learning, and how to improve its accuracy and reliability. This is my personal Repo, here you will find branches to different projects Iâ€™ve completed. Before you read on

Some of my work is copyrighted and protected by the University of Brighton. So be advised that some of my work does not YET appear here. I am working through it, and making changes to my existing work to create an open source area. Therefore all work uploaded to github will be copyright free and free to use as you wish. However this does hinder my ability to routinely upload projects. Work will be uploaded as and when.

P.S. My work relating to my Doctorate, which will eventually be uploaded to this space, but will not be uploaded until after publication and alteration as per the above statement.
