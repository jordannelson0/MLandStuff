# Genetics Project
This Project uses the genetics library to correctly guess passwords using a gene set. Attached are two python files as well as a PDF document detailing how the code works, this document is very basic but should help you understand the code and how it works better. Why? Because there's nothing worse than siting there, staring at your IDE wondering "what is this?"
